## Problem 1

```{r weather data}
weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```
The boostrap is helpful when you’d like to perform inference for a parameter / value / summary that doesn’t have an easy-to-write-down distribution in the usual repeated sampling framework. 
1. We’ll focus on a simple linear regression with tmax as the response and tmin as the predictor, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities estimated from these data:
$$
\hat{r}^2
$$
$$
log(\hat{\beta_0}*\hat{\beta_1})
$$
* Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce estimates of these two quantities.
```{r 5k bootstrap samples}
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::glance)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = r.squared)) + geom_density()
```

2. Plot the distribution of your estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95% confidence interval for r̂ 2 and log(β̂ 0∗β̂ 1)
*Note: `broom::glance()` is helpful for extracting r̂ 2 from a fitted regression, and`broom::tidy()` (with some additional wrangling) should help in computing log(β̂ 0∗β̂ 1).
```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  modelr::bootstrap(n = 1000) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(strap, ~lm(tmax ~ tmin, data = .x) ),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-strap, -models) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  select(id = `.id`, term, estimate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = term, 
    values_from = estimate) %>% 
  rename(beta0 = `(Intercept)`, beta1 = tmin) %>% 
  mutate(log_b0b1 = log(beta0 * beta1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = log_b0b1)) + geom_density()
```


## Problem 2
```{r}
library(RCurl)
x <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv")
hom_df <- read.csv(text = x)
```

1. Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. 
*Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. For this problem, limit your analysis those for whom victim_race is white or black. Be sure that victim_age is numeric.
```{r}
tidyhom_df = hom_df %>%
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "), #create city_state variable
         resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"), #create 1=resolved or 0=unresolved
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
         victim_sex = fct_relevel(victim_sex, "Female"),
         city_state = ifelse(city_state %in% c("Milwaukee, wI"), "Milwaukee, WI", city_state),
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White")) %>% #fixing Milwaukee, wI to WI
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
         !victim_sex %in% c("Unknown")) %>% #39,693 obs before drop_na(victim_age)
  drop_na(victim_age) %>% #39,403 obs after drop_na(victim_age) (290 less)
  select(victim_race, victim_age, victim_sex, city_state, resolved)

##this was used to double check that the NA coercion in as.numeric(victim_age) -> drop_na(victim_age)
#tidyhom_df %>%
#  select(city_state, victim_race, victim_age) %>%
#  filter(victim_age == "Unknown") %>%
#  count #290 unknown ages

##checking totals on number of age 0's
tidyhom_df %>%
  select(city_state, victim_race, victim_age) %>%
  #group_by(city_state) %>%
  filter(victim_age == "0") %>%
  count #297 homicides at age 0
```


2. For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the glm function to fit a logistic regression with (`outcome`) resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and `victim age`, `sex` and `race` as predictors.

*Save the output of glm as an R object; 
*Apply the `broom::tidy` to this object;
*Obtain the estimate and confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables fixed.
```{r baltimore}
fit_logistic_baltimore = 
  tidyhom_df %>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>%
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 

fit_logistic_baltimore %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         OR.ci.low = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
         OR.ci.high = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)) %>%
  select(term, log_OR = estimate, OR, OR.ci.low, OR.ci.high, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

3. Now run glm for each of the cities in your dataset;
*Extract the adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male victims to female victims. 
*Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of `purrr::map`, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
```{rglm for all cities}
glm_all = 
  tidyhom_df %>%
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% #need to remove to resolve issues with select later
  mutate(model = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())),
         result = map(.x=model, ~broom::tidy(.x,conf.int = TRUE))) %>% 
  select(city_state, result) %>% 
  unnest(result) %>%
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    OR.ci.low = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    OR.ci.high = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, starts_with("OR")) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale")
```

4. Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city. Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.
```{r}
glm_all %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, -OR)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = OR, y = city_state)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = OR.ci.low , xmax = OR.ci.high)) +
  labs(title = "OR's resolved Homicide Cases based on Victim Sex across 47 Cities",
       y = "City, State",
       x = "Odds Ratio Male vs Female (95% CI)")
```


##Problem 3
Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two. Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main effects only)
One using head circumference, length, sex, and all interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these
Make this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use crossv_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect your model to be “optimal”.
